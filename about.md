With close to 10 years of experience developing software, I took a variety of roles, leading projects and teams as technical lead, scrum master or architect, in small companies as well as on the largest .Net system in the nordics.  
I am a System Architect who thrives in face of challenges. I enjoy making teams and development more efficient, friction-less, making  systems more robust, and code more maintainable. 
I share my technical obsessions of the moment at internal events, user groups, and conferences.
