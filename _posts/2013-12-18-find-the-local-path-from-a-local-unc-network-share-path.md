Just making sure that I will know where to find this if I need it again in the future.

If you have a UNC network share path, such as \Computer1\Shared and you need to know the local folder linked to that when running a script from Computer1,  you can achieve that easily in powershellÂ :

    gwmi win32_share | ? {$_.Name -eq "Shared" } | select -expand path
